# Data structures and Algorithms

Data structures and algorithms implemented in python,c,c++ and in Java  

## Applications

DSA are applicabale in our day to day lives from browsers,online booking systems,bank queues,Music players on our phones to google Maps their use cases are basically endless  

For many problems, the ability to formulate an efficient algorithm depends on being able to
organize the data in an appropriate manner.  
Data structure denotes a particular way of organizing data for particular types of operation.  
This Repository therefore look at numerous data structures ranging from familiar arrays and lists to more complex structures such as **trees**,**heaps** and **graphs**  
Further i explore their implementation in **C** ,**C++**, **Python** and in **Java** programming languages showing how their choice affects the efficiency of the algorithms based upon them.

## They include

Arrays  
Queues  
Stacks  
Singly linked lists  
Doubly linked lists  
Trees  
Graphs  
Heaps  

## Algorithms

Searching Algorithms
Sorting- Quicksort,Mergesort,Timsort,Heapsort,Bubblesort,Insertion sort,Selection sort, Tree sort,Shell sort,Bucket sort,Radix sort,Counting sort and Cube sort
Graph algorithms - Topological sort, Floyd-Warshal algorithm,prims algotithm,Dijkistra's algorithm, Bellman-ford algorithm, A* search algorithm
